# 🚀 GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Account**: Make sure you have a GitHub account
2. **Git**: Install Git if not already installed
3. **Command Line Tools**: For macOS, you might need to install Xcode Command Line Tools

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Install Command Line Tools (if needed)
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

### 2. Initialize Git Repository
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /Users/carlotaperezprieto/Downloads/TRUCCONEW-main

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Make initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: TRUCCO Analytics Dashboard with Improved ML Models"
```

### 3. Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in
2. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right corner
3. **Select "New repository"**
4. **Repository name**: `trucco-analytics-dashboard`
5. **Description**: `Advanced sales analytics and prediction dashboard with improved machine learning models`
6. **Make it Public** (or Private if you prefer)
7. **Don't initialize with README** (we already have one)
8. **Click "Create repository"**

### 4. Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/carlotapprieto/trucco-analytics-dashboard.git

# Set the main branch
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 📁 Project Structure

Your repository will contain:

```
trucco-analytics-dashboard/
├── app.py                    # 🎯 Main Streamlit application
├── dashboard.py              # 📊 Dashboard logic and functions
├── modelo.py                 # 🤖 ML model functions and training
├── run_model_improved.py     # 🚀 Model training script
├── requirements.txt          # 📦 Python dependencies
├── README.md                 # 📖 Project documentation
├── README_MODEL.md           # 🤖 Model documentation
├── .gitignore               # 🚫 Git ignore rules
├── data/                    # 📊 Data folder (training data)
├── assets/                  # 🎨 Assets folder (logos, images)
├── modelos_mejorados/       # 🏆 Improved trained models
├── modelos_finales/         # 🔄 Backup models
└── catboost_info/           # 📈 Model training info
```

## 🔒 Important Notes

### Data Privacy
- The `data/` folder contains your training data
- Consider if you want to include this in the public repository
- You can add `data/*.xlsx` to `.gitignore` if you want to exclude data files

### Model Files
- The `modelos_mejorados/` and `modelos_finales/` folders contain trained models
- These are large files and might take time to upload
- Consider using Git LFS for large files if needed
